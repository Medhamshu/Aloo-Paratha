Make the dough
In a bowl mix together whole wheat flour (atta), oil and salt. Add water little by little and mix.
Knead to form a smooth and soft dough. Cover and let the dough rest for 15-20 minutes.
Divide the dough into 4-6 equal parts.
Make the filling
To make the filling, mash the boiled potatoes and transfer to a bowl.
Add chopped cilantro, salt, ajwain, chopped green chili, cumin powder, chat masala, garam masala powder, amchur and red chili powder.
Mix till everything is well combined. The stuffing is now ready.
Make the paratha
Take one of the dough balls and using your rolling pin roll it into a circle. Apply little oil (optional) all over the rolled dough.
Place 2-3 tablespoons of stuffing in the center. Don't overfill else it will be difficult to roll.
Bring all the edges together and pinch to seal the edges.
Flatten the dough ball using your hands.
Now using your rolling pin, roll the dough to a circle of 7-8 inch diameter. The trick here is to apply equal pressure while rolling. If you do that, your paratha will turn round automatically.
Transfer the rolled paratha onto the hot tawa.
Cook the side for a minute or two and then flip over. Apply oil [around 1/4 teaspoon] on the half-cooked side and flip again.
Now apply oil on the other side as well. Press with a spatula and cook the paratha till both sides have golden brown spots on them.
Repeat with the remaining dough balls.
